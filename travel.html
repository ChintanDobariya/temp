                    <p class="con">Sitting on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas, the Land of the Thunder Dragon is a landlocked country bordered by Tibet and India. Bhutan holds a policy of attracting high-value low impact tourism and the country is therefore not your typical backpacker budget destination.</p>
                    <center><img src="img/Bhutan2.jpg" style="width: 60%;"></center>
                    <p class="con">Bhutan has been implementing conservation and eco-friendly practices long before the rest 
                        of the world caught up and is the world‚Äôs first carbon-negative country. Television and internet were only 
                        introduced to the country in 1999, plastic bags and cigarettes are banned, and Bhutan‚Äôs constitution, states that 60% of the total area needs to remain forested at all times. All these measures result in a very unique nation which is lush, green, and absolutely gorgeous. Bhutanese people take great pride in their country and genuinely care about living in harmony with their environment, themselves appreciating their relative 
                        isolation from the outside world, believing that more exposure to it could only leave a negative impact.</p>                    
                    <h2>Here are our top 5  awesome things to do in Bhutan</h2>
                    <h2>1. Hike up to Tiger‚Äôs Nest</h2>
                    <p class="con">The Tiger‚Äôs Nest Monastery (Paro Takstang) is one of Bhutan‚Äôs most iconic landmarks and its image is probably the one most associated with the country. The monastery is located at the side of a steep cliff wall in the Paro valley and legend has it that this location was chosen by a tigress who brought Guru Rinpoche (an important figure in the Buddhist religion) to the site to subdue a local demon. It is a steep two hours‚Äô hike up to the monastery, during which you can stop for a tea break at a little cafe with wonderful views of the monastery on the way up. You can also hire a horse to take you up the hill but you still need to do some walking so be sure to wear comfy shoes anyway!</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>2. Visit the Temple of The Divine Madman</h2>
                    <p class="con">Does being hit on the head by a wooden penis sound like a blessing to you? Well it is in Bhutan! The Temple of The Divine Madman (yes really) is a pilgrimage site for childless couples who are blessed in the temple in the hope of becoming fertile. I wasn‚Äôt 100% aware of this at the time the monk was performing the blessing on me, and listened in horror as I was afterwards told that I would most likely now fall pregnant.  And who is the Divine Madman you may ask? Drupa Kunley was a monk who wanted to show that it is possible to become enlightened without giving up on earthly pleasures, so his methods included ‚Äúblessing‚Äù women with sex (again, yes really).</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>3. Experience a Homestay</h2>
                    <p class="con">One of the experiences we enjoyed most in Bhutan was spending some time with a local family on their farm in the Paro valley. Our bed was a hard mattress on the floor covered in pink blankets and dinner was rice flavoured with pork fat and butter tea (that‚Äôs tea churned with actual butter, in case you‚Äôre wondering). The kind owners prepared a traditional hot stone bath in an outhouse consisting of rickety wooden bath, filled with water from a nearby stream reputed to have medicinal properties, heated by placing in it large stones which had been thrown into a fire. Despite not having any noticeable effects on our health, the long relaxing soak ensured that we spent that night blissfully snoring away until we were rudely woken up by the farm animals in the early morning.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>4. Attend a Traditional Festival</h2>
                    <p class="con">Like everything else in the country, Bhutan‚Äôs festivals are overflowing with colour and mystical legends. Religious festivals (Tshechu) are celebrated in several parts of the country and are considered to be very special events where locals gather to watch masked dancers and singers perform whilst taking the opportunity to socialise. Plays involving some type of drama depicting good and evil (from the little we could understand) are also held, and it is great fun to watch the locals ‚Äúooh‚Äù and ‚Äúahhh‚Äù over a particular story or event. You might even be asked to participate in a scene much to everyone‚Äôs certain delight!</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>5. Visit the Punakha Dzong</h2>
                    <p class="con">Dzongs are fort-monasteries found throughout Bhutan, significant not only because of their particular structure, but also because they are the administrative and religious centres of Bhutanese communities. The most beautiful of these is the Punakha Dzong, otherwise known as the ‚ÄúPalace of Great Happiness‚Äù. The dzong stands at the point where the rivers Po chhu and Mo chhu converge and is one of the the most picturesque structures in the entire country. Additionally, the dzong itself features typical detailed Buddhist symbols and murals some of which depict the life of Buddha. You can also experience rafting on the rivers like we did, although it is not something we would really recommend to adrenaline seekers!</p>
